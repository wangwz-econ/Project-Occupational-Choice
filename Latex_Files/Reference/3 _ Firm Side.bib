	annote = {A dynamic general equilibrium model.
In the firm side, there are two sectors, service and manufacture, which differ in the per period fixed cost to operate, leading to the scale difference between the two sectors. And credit market is incomplete in the sense of strict borrowing limit.
In the hh side, each individual has a vector of talent z and accumulate wealth. In each period, he needs to choose between becoming an employee, becoming a service establishment owner and becoming a manufacturing establishment owner. 
This paper compares different equilibria with or without strict credit constraint.
