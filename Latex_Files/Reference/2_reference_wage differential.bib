	abstract = {Analysis of data from the PSID reveals that idiosyncratic wage volatility varies inversely with inter-industry wage differentials and is positively correlated with both returns to industry tenure and rates of inter-industry mobility. An incomplete markets life cycle model in which inter-industry mobility decisions and wage differentials are endogenously determined in equilibrium is then developed and shown to be capable of rationalizing these features of the data. In the model, the ability of worker to switch industries generates option value that is large enough to offset the standard risk premium that workers demand for exposure to excess wage volatility.},

In the model, in each period, the agent needs to determine whether to have the right to change industry (an option), and whether to change industry, given a realization of certain productivity shocks.
It first shows, empirically, in US, wage volatility and wage differential are negatively correlated cross different industries. This implies that labor income risks in different industries do not drive the wage differentials.
Then it shows that we need to take inter-industry mobility into consideration. It brings selection bias into the observed data patterns.
This highlights the role of inter-industry mobility in shaping people’s observed industry choice!

Agents with different initial abilities at the date 0 choose between different industries (which differ in permanant and transitory risks).
This paper studies the role of selection, permanant and transitory risks on mean earnings difference across different industries.
No human capital accumulation process!

Individuals first choose a schooling level, and then in the later periods choose consumption and time allocated to on-the-job human capital accumulation. Each schooling level has its own human capital production function and has its own price of per unit of effective human capital.
In the firm side, hc from different schooling levels are imperfect substitues, while hc from the same schooling level is perfect substitute. The aggreation provides a price path for each cohort.
Extremely relevant!
But I still need to extend the model to two-sector, and incorporate individuals’ sector choice.
