	abstract = {With risk-averse workers and uninsurable earnings shocks, competitive markets allocate too few workers to jobs with high earnings uncertainty. Using an equilibrium Roy model with incomplete markets, we show that risky occupations are inefﬁciently small and hence talent is misallocated. We obtain analytical expressions for the compensation for risk in the labor market, and for the aggregate level of human capital and output. We also study the welfare properties of the economy and derive solutions for both the ﬁrst-best allocation and the constrainedefﬁcient allocation. Misallocation is positively related to the correlation between a worker’s abilities in different occupations. Quantitatively we ﬁnd that market incompleteness can by itself generate permanent output and welfare losses in the order of one percent of GDP. Around 35\% of the loss is due to the presence of the pecuniary externality.},

Using a life-cycle model with a version of a Ben-Porath (1967) human capital accumulation technology, stationary equilibria of calibrated cases are analyzed in which risk arises from specialization risk and career risk. With career risk only, stationary equilibria resemble those studied by Aiyagari (1994), and the impact of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk is relatively small. With a signiﬁcant amount of specialization risk, however, stationary equilibria are severely distorted, with human capital about 57 percent as large as its complete markets counterpart.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates whether capital and human capital are over-accumulated in an incomplete market economy. As in Dávila et al. (2012), whether capital is over-accumulated depends on how the pecuniary externalities affect insurance and redistribution. In a human capital economy, however, not only capital but also human capital generates externalities and an additional channel arises that has implications for the overaccumulation (under-accumulation) of capital (human capital). The income sources of the poor and the correlation between wealth and human capital are crucial for the implication of pecuniary externalities. Realistically calibrated models exhibit under-accumulation (overaccumulation) of capital (human capital). (JEL D52, D62, I26, J22, J24, J31)},

We find that, as of age 23, differences in initial conditions account for more of the variation in lifetime earnings, lifetime wealth, and lifetime utility than do differences in shocks received over the working lifetime.

The relative number of college-educated workers has also increased dramatically in the postwar period. This paper presents a uniﬁed framework where the dynamics of both skill accumulation and wage inequality arise as an equilibrium outcome driven by measured investmentspeciﬁc technological change. Working through equipment–skill complementarity and endogenous skill accumulation, the model does well in capturing the steady growth in the relative quantity of skilled labor during the postwar period and the substantial rise in wage inequality after the early 1980s. Based on the calibrated model, we examine the quantitative effects of some hypothetical tax-policy reforms on skill accumulation, wage inequality, and welfare.},

In our setting, a worker’s human capital is driven by his labor market choices, given idiosyncratic occupation-speciﬁc productivity shocks and the costs of switching occupations. We characterize the equilibrium assignment of workers to jobs and show that the resulting evolution of aggregate human capital across occupations ultimately determines the long-run rate of growth of the economy. We then use our model to quantitatively study the dynamic impact of labor-saving technical changes, e.g. automation, on the workers’ occupational choices, and on the economy’s income inequality, job polarization and long-run growth.},
