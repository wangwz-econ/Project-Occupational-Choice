Two occupations in the world (risk and safe one), reflected by the variation of the income process.
Each individual has a predetermined vector of occupation-specific abilities (drawn from a prior distribution).
Individual chooses a specific occupation, the one that maximizes his expected utility.
Use the general market clearing condition to pin down other aggregate variables: occupational share, output, wage premium.

Agents face occupation-specific risks (including wage risk, employment risks, etc) and decide whethe to change occupation in each period (also, they need to choose between different occupational offers if being unemployed and given different offers).
A good paper for replication.
However, there is so little discussion devoted to human capital accumulation choice, which should be my focus.

In the model, in each period, the agent needs to determine whether to have the right to change industry (an option), and whether to change industry, given a realization of certain productivity shocks.
It first shows, empirically, in US, wage volatility and wage differential are negatively correlated cross different industries. This implies that labor income risks in different industries do not drive the wage differentials.
Then it shows that we need to take inter-industry mobility into consideration. It brings selection bias into the observed data patterns.
This highlights the role of inter-industry mobility in shaping people’s observed industry choice!

This paper investiages whether progressive tax can partially insure people so that they are more motivated to switch their occupations and find the more suitable one.
