The model is estimated using the HILDA dataset from Australia. Personality traits are found to play an important role in explaining education and occupation choices over the lifecycle. Results show that individuals with a comparative advantage in schooling and white‐collar work have, on average, higher cognitive skills and higher personality trait scores. Allowing personality traits to evolve with age and with schooling proves to be important to capturing the heterogeneity in how people respond to educational policies. The estimated model is used to evaluate two education policies: compulsory senior secondary school and a 50\% college tuition subsidy. Both policies increase educational attainment and also affect personality traits.},

Using an equilibrium Roy model with incomplete markets, we show that risky occupations are inefﬁciently small and hence talent is misallocated. We obtain analytical expressions for the compensation for risk in the labor market, and for the aggregate level of human capital and output. We also study the welfare properties of the economy and derive solutions for both the ﬁrst-best allocation and the constrainedefﬁcient allocation. Misallocation is positively related to the correlation between a worker’s abilities in different occupations. Quantitatively we ﬁnd that market incompleteness can by itself generate permanent output and welfare losses in the order of one percent of GDP. Around 35\% of the loss is due to the presence of the pecuniary externality.},

The income sources of the poor and the correlation between wealth and human capital are crucial for the implication of pecuniary externalities.

Individuals first choose a schooling level, and then in the later periods choose consumption and time allocated to on-the-job human capital accumulation. Each schooling level has its own human capital production function and has its own price of per unit of effective human capital.
In the firm side, hc from different schooling levels are imperfect substitues, while hc from the same schooling level is perfect substitute. The aggreation provides a price path for each cohort.
Extremely relevant!
But I still need to extend the model to two-sector, and incorporate individuals’ sector choice.

	abstract = {We develop a quantitative framework to explain the relationship between aggregate/sector-level total factor productivity (TFP) and financial development across countries. Financial frictions distort the allocation of capital and entrepreneurial talent across production units, adversely affecting measured productivity. In our model, sectors with larger scales of operation (e.g., manufacturing) have more financing needs, and are hence disproportionately vulnerable to financial frictions. Our quantitative analysis shows that financial frictions account for a substantial part of the observed cross-country differences in output per worker, aggregate TFP, sector-level relative productivity, and capital-to-output ratios.

In the firm side, there are two sectors, service and manufacture, which differ in the per period fixed cost to operate, leading to the scale difference between the two sectors. And credit market is incomplete in the sense of strict borrowing limit.
In the hh side, each individual has a vector of talent z and accumulate wealth. In each period, he needs to choose between becoming an employee, becoming a service establishment owner and becoming a manufacturing establishment owner. 
This paper compares different equilibria with or without strict credit constraint.

Under incomplete markets, low-asset workers remain in low-productivity occupations even when the expected value of switching is positive. In a calibrated model, completing markets against earnings risk improves welfare by up to 3.5 percent of lifetime consumption, in part because workers move into better occupations, but also thanks to improved consumption smoothing. We also investigate policies aﬀecting mobility. Subsidizing retraining increases mobility away from low-productivity occupations, but does not improve average welfare. A progressive tax-and-transfer scheme decreases mobility, but improves welfare through redistribution.},

	abstract = {We introduce a neoclassical growth economy with idiosyncratic production risk and incomplete markets. Each agent is an entrepreneur operating her own technology with her own capital stock. The general equilibrium is characterized by a closed-form recursion in the CARA-normal case. Incomplete markets introduce a risk premium on private equity, which reduces the demand for investment. As compared to complete markets, the steady state can thus have both a lower capital stock due to investment risk, and a lower interest rate due to precautionary savings. Furthermore, the anticipation of high real interest rates in the future feeds back into high risk premia and low investment in the present, thus slowing down convergence to the steady state.},

We study a model of establishment dynamics in which financial frictions reduce TFP through two channels. First, finance frictions distort entry and technology adoption decisions. Second, finance frictions generate dispersion in the returns to capital across existing producers and thus productivity losses from misallocation. Parameterizations of our model consistent with the data imply fairly small losses from misallocation, but potentially sizable losses from inefficiently low levels of entry and technology adoption.
