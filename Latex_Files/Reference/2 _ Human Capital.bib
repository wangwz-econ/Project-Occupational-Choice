Individuals face two labor earnings risks: specialization shocks and career shocks, which cannot be fully insured.
Individuals choose on-the-job training time to accumulate human capital, which can also be depreciated.
It compares different stationary equilibria generated by complete market model, incomplete market models with career risk only and with both risks.
Age Profiles are also interesting.

	annote = {A dynamic feneral equilibrium (with OLG features) model, but without uninsurable risks.
Individuals first choose a schooling level, and then in the later periods choose consumption and time allocated to on-the-job human capital accumulation. Each schooling level has its own human capital production function and has its own price of per unit of effective human capital.
In the firm side, hc from different schooling levels are imperfect substitues, while hc from the same schooling level is perfect substitute. The aggreation provides a price path for each cohort.
Extremely relevant!
But I still need to extend the model to two-sector, and incorporate individuals’ sector choice.

The key elements of the model is that each agent has an initial draw of wealth and human capital (initial condition) and faces human capital risk (the only source of idiosyncratic risk in the model).
The firm side is conventional.
It compares which - initial conditions or realization of hc risk is more important in generating people’s lifetime earnings inequality.
