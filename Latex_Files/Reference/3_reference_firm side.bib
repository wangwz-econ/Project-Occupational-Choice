	abstract = {We develop a quantitative framework to explain the relationship between aggregate/sector-level total factor productivity (TFP) and financial development across countries. Financial frictions distort the allocation of capital and entrepreneurial talent across production units, adversely affecting measured productivity. In our model, sectors with larger scales of operation (e.g., manufacturing) have more financing needs, and are hence disproportionately vulnerable to financial frictions. Our quantitative analysis shows that financial frictions account for a substantial part of the observed cross-country differences in output per worker, aggregate TFP, sector-level relative productivity, and capital-to-output ratios.

In the firm side, there are two sectors, service and manufacture, which differ in the per period fixed cost to operate, leading to the scale difference between the two sectors. And credit market is incomplete in the sense of strict borrowing limit.
In the hh side, each individual has a vector of talent z and accumulate wealth. In each period, he needs to choose between becoming an employee, becoming a service establishment owner and becoming a manufacturing establishment owner. 
This paper compares different equilibria with or without strict credit constraint.

	abstract = {We study the eﬀects of market incompleteness on occupational mobility. Under incomplete markets, low-asset workers remain in low-productivity occupations even when the expected value of switching is positive. In a calibrated model, completing markets against earnings risk improves welfare by up to 3.5 percent of lifetime consumption, in part because workers move into better occupations, but also thanks to improved consumption smoothing. We also investigate policies aﬀecting mobility. Subsidizing retraining increases mobility away from low-productivity occupations, but does not improve average welfare. A progressive tax-and-transfer scheme decreases mobility, but improves welfare through redistribution.},

	abstract = {We introduce a neoclassical growth economy with idiosyncratic production risk and incomplete markets. Each agent is an entrepreneur operating her own technology with her own capital stock. The general equilibrium is characterized by a closed-form recursion in the CARA-normal case. Incomplete markets introduce a risk premium on private equity, which reduces the demand for investment. As compared to complete markets, the steady state can thus have both a lower capital stock due to investment risk, and a lower interest rate due to precautionary savings. Furthermore, the anticipation of high real interest rates in the future feeds back into high risk premia and low investment in the present, thus slowing down convergence to the steady state.},

	abstract = {We use producer-level data to evaluate the role of financial frictions in determining total factor productivity (TFP). We study a model of establishment dynamics in which financial frictions reduce TFP through two channels. First, finance frictions distort entry and technology adoption decisions. Second, finance frictions generate dispersion in the returns to capital across existing producers and thus productivity losses from misallocation. Parameterizations of our model consistent with the data imply fairly small losses from misallocation, but potentially sizable losses from inefficiently low levels of entry and technology adoption.
