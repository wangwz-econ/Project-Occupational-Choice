Agents face occupation-specific risks (including wage risk, employment risks, etc) and decide whethe to change occupation in each period (also, they need to choose between different occupational offers if being unemployed and given different offers).
A good paper for replication.
However, there is so little discussion devoted to human capital accumulation choice, which should be my focus.

	abstract = {We study the eﬀects of market incompleteness on occupational mobility. Under incomplete markets, low-asset workers remain in low-productivity occupations even when the expected value of switching is positive. In a calibrated model, completing markets against earnings risk improves welfare by up to 3.5 percent of lifetime consumption, in part because workers move into better occupations, but also thanks to improved consumption smoothing. We also investigate policies aﬀecting mobility. Subsidizing retraining increases mobility away from low-productivity occupations, but does not improve average welfare. A progressive tax-and-transfer scheme decreases mobility, but improves welfare through redistribution.},

	abstract = {We develop a tractable dynamic Roy model in which inﬁnitely-lived workers choose occupations to maximize their lifetime utility. In our setting, a worker’s human capital is driven by his labor market choices, given idiosyncratic occupation-speciﬁc productivity shocks and the costs of switching occupations. We characterize the equilibrium assignment of workers to jobs and show that the resulting evolution of aggregate human capital across occupations ultimately determines the long-run rate of growth of the economy. We then use our model to quantitatively study the dynamic impact of labor-saving technical changes, e.g. automation, on the workers’ occupational choices, and on the economy’s income inequality, job polarization and long-run growth.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a dynamic model of schooling and occupational choices that incorporates personality traits, as measured by the “big five” traits. The model is estimated using the HILDA dataset from Australia. Personality traits are found to play an important role in explaining education and occupation choices over the lifecycle. Results show that individuals with a comparative advantage in schooling and white‐collar work have, on average, higher cognitive skills and higher personality trait scores. Allowing personality traits to evolve with age and with schooling proves to be important to capturing the heterogeneity in how people respond to educational policies. The estimated model is used to evaluate two education policies: compulsory senior secondary school and a 50\% college tuition subsidy. Both policies increase educational attainment and also affect personality traits.},
