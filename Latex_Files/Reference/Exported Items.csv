This learning process is consistent with a number of key facts about occupational mobility, such as the offsetting worker ﬂows across occupations, the non-random patterns of occupational transitions, and the decline of occupational switching with age. We illustrate how search frictions delay learning and lead to mismatch, thereby reducing worker productivity. Moreover, we explore how different workers perform in different occupations. Are the best workers in one occupation also the best workers in another occupation (one-dimensional model of ability)? Or are some workers good at one occupation and other workers good at a different one (comparative advantage model)? The calibration favours the model of comparative advantage, as opposed to the widely used one-dimensional ability model. We use the calibrated model to investigate how the level of unemployment beneﬁts affects worker productivity.","2014-07","2023-05-12 10:27:02","2023-05-14 11:08:24","2023-05-12 10:27:02","1263-1295","","3","81","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","E:\_Literature_Zotero\storage\7H4RSJNQ\Learning Your Comparative Advantages - Review of Economic Studies - 2014.pdf","","not so relevant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such redistributive policies entail distortions to labor supply and savings, but also serve as partial substitutes for missing credit and insurance markets. The resulting tradeoffs for growth and efﬁciency are explored, both theoretically and quantitatively, in a model that yields complete analytical solutions. Progressive education ﬁnance always leads to higher income growth than taxes and transfers, but at the cost of lower insurance. Overall efﬁciency is assessed using a new measure that properly reﬂects aggregate resources and idiosyncratic risks but, unlike a standard social welfare function, does not reward equality per se. Simulations using empirical parameter estimates show that the efﬁciency costs and beneﬁts of redistribution are generally of the same order of magnitude, resulting in plausible values for the optimal rates. Aggregate income and aggregate welfare provide only crude lower and upper bounds around the true efﬁciency tradeoff.","2002","2023-05-12 10:27:11","2023-06-15 18:36:31","","481-517","","2","70","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","E:\_Literature_Zotero\storage\YX9JJP8B\Tax and Education Policy in a Heterogenous-Agent Economy - What Levels of - Econometrica - 2002.pdf","","not so relevant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on the notion of constrained efficiency used in the general equilibrium literature. Our characterization of constrained efficiency uses the first-order condition of a constrained planner’s problem. This condition highlights the margins of relevance for whether capital is too high or too low: the factor composition of income of the (consumption-)poor. Using three calibrations commonly considered in the literature, we illustrate that there can be either over- or underaccumulation of capital in steady state and that the constrained optimum may or may not be consistent with a nondegenerate long-run distribution of wealth. For the calibration that roughly matches the income and wealth distribution, the constrained inefficiency of the market outcome is rather striking: it has much too low a steady-state capital stock.","2012","2023-05-12 10:27:15","2023-06-15 18:16:06","2023-05-12 10:27:15","2431-2467","","6","80","","Econometrica","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","E:\_Literature_Zotero\storage\LNXT78EV\Constrained Efficiency in the Neoclassical Growth Model With Uninsurable - Econometrica - 2012.pdf","","not so relevant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key ﬁnding is that structural transformation aﬀects primarily the young. More than half of all structural transformation happens between cohorts, meaning that new cohorts choose diﬀerent sectors than existing ones. Half of the within-cohort reallocation happens by age 30 and most by age 40. We develop and calibrate an overlapping generations model of structural transformation with sector-speciﬁc human capital investments that replicates these and other stylized facts. The model generates much slower transitional dynamics than the standard growth model even in the face of a large, one-time shock to TFP.","2017","2023-05-12 10:27:20","2023-06-15 18:36:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","E:\_Literature_Zotero\storage\8A6B9TXE\Structural Transformation by Cohort - Working Paper - 2017.pdf","","not so relevant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article surveys the theoretical and empirical literature that models a worker’s life-cycle earnings and identiﬁes appropriate discount rates to translate those cash ﬂows into a certainty equivalent of wealth. We begin with an overview of a stylized model of human capital valuation with exogenous labor income. We then discuss extensions to this framework that study the underlying economic sources of labor income shocks, the choices that people make during their lives (such as about work, leisure, retirement, and investment in education), and the implications of these factors for human capital valuation and risk.","2015","2023-05-12 19:33:04","2023-06-15 18:37:41","","179–200","","","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","E:\_Literature_Zotero\storage\5K2YPJ44\The Value and Risk of Human Capital - Annual Review of Financial Economics - 2015.pdf","","not so relevant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that such a framework significantly reduces the measured gains from education relative to simple present-value calculations, although the gains remain significant. For example, for a range of preference parameters, we find that individuals should be willing to pay 300 to 500 (200 to 250) thousand dollars to obtain a college (high school) degree in order to benefit from the 32 to 42 percent (20 to 38 percent) increase in annual certainty-equivalent consumption. We also explore how the measured value of education varies with preference parameters, by gender, and across time. In contrast to findings in the education wage-premia literature, which focuses on present values and which we replicate in our data, our model indicates that the gains from college education were flat in the 1980s and actually decreased significantly in 1991-2007 period. On the other hand, the gains to a high school education have increased quite dramatically over time.

This paper presents a uniﬁed framework where the dynamics of both skill accumulation and wage inequality arise as an equilibrium outcome driven by measured investmentspeciﬁc technological change. Working through equipment–skill complementarity and endogenous skill accumulation, the model does well in capturing the steady growth in the relative quantity of skilled labor during the postwar period and the substantial rise in wage inequality after the early 1980s.

A simple regression analysis demonstrates that the capital–skill ratio has a positive and signiﬁcant relation to the skill premium at business cycle frequencies as predicted by the capital–skill complementarity hypothesis. This ﬁnding motivates the construction of a stochastic dynamic general equilibrium model that allows for capital–skill complementarity in production. The model with capital–skill complementarity can account for the cyclical behavior of the skill premium and much of its volatility. The model without capital–skill complementarity cannot.

Hours are the main driver of the negative skewness and, to a lesser extent, the high kurtosis of earnings changes. Even though we ﬁnd no evidence of added-worker effects, the presence of spousal earnings reduces the variability of household income compared to that of male earnings. In the Netherlands, government transfers are a major source of insurance, substantially reducing the standard deviation, negative skewness, and kurtosis of income changes.

This holds for individual-pre-tax and household-post-tax earnings and across administrative and survey data. We estimate two alternative processes for household after-tax earnings and study their implications using a standard life-cycle model. Both processes feature a persistent and a transitory component, but although the first one is the canonical linear process with stationary shocks, the second one has substantially richer earnings dynamics, allowing for age-dependence of moments, non-normality, and nonlinearity in previous earnings and age. Allowing for richer earnings dynamics implies a substantially better fit of the evolution of cross-sectional consumption inequality over the life cycle and of the individual-level degree of consumption insurance against persistent earnings shocks. The richer earnings process implies lower welfare costs of earnings risk.","2020-04-01","2023-05-26 23:11:22","2023-06-15 18:31:53","2023-05-26 23:11:22","890-926","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","E:\_Literature_Zotero\storage\T7V9G5W6\Nonlinear Household Earnings Dynamics, Self-Insurance, and Welfare - Journal of the European Economic Association - 2020.pdf","","not so relevant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consumption is modeled as an age-dependent nonlinear function of assets, unobservable tastes, and the two earnings components. We establish the nonparametric identiﬁcation of the nonlinear earnings process and of the consumption policy rule. Exploiting the enhanced consumption and asset data in recent waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we ﬁnd that the earnings process features nonlinear persistence and conditional skewness. We conﬁrm these results using population register data from Norway.

Second, it applies our method to estimate a nonparametric earnings process using two data sets: the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and a large, synthetic, data set that matches the dynamics of the U.S. tax earnings. Third, it uses a life cycle model of consumption to compare the consumption and saving implications of our two estimated processes to those of a standard AR(1).

We accomplish this task by using indirect inference to estimate a structural consumption–savings model, in which individuals both learn about the nature of their income process and partly insure shocks via informal mechanisms. In this framework, we estimate (i) the degree of partial insurance, (ii) the extent of systematic differences in income growth rates, (iii) the precision with which individuals know their own income growth rates when they begin their working lives, (iv) the persistence of typical labor income shocks, (v) the tightness of borrowing constraints, and (vi) the amount of measurement error in the data. In implementing indirect inference, we ﬁnd that an auxiliary model that approximates the true structural equations of the model (which are not estimable) works very well, with negligible small sample bias. The main substantive ﬁndings are that income shocks are moderately persistent, systematic differences in income growth rates are large, individuals have substantial amounts of information about their income growth rates, and about one-half of income shocks are smoothed via partial insurance. Putting these ﬁndings together, the amount of uninsurable lifetime income risk that individuals perceive is substantially smaller than what is typically assumed in calibrated macroeconomic models with incomplete markets.","2014-11","2023-06-16 19:34:37","2023-06-16 23:29:47","2023-06-16 19:34:37","2085-2129","","6","82","","Econometrica","Inferring Labor Income Risk and Partial Insurance From Economic Choices","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","E:\_Literature_Zotero\storage\U8B8AMAC\Inferring Labor Income Risk and Partial Insurance From Economic Choices - - Econometrica - 2014.pdf","","not so relevant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper addresses this question within a model where ﬁrms engage in two types of investment: a short-term one; and a long-term one, which contributes more to productivity growth. Because it takes longer to complete, long-term investment has a relatively less cyclical return; but it also has a higher liquidity risk. The ﬁrst effect ensures that the share of long-term investment to total investment is countercyclical when ﬁnancial markets are perfect; the second implies that this share may turn procyclical when ﬁrms face tight credit constraints. A novel propagation mechanism thus emerges: through its effect on the cyclical composition of investment, tighter credit can lead to both higher volatility and lower mean growth. Evidence from a panel of countries provides support for the model’s key predictions.","2010-04","2023-06-18 09:35:56","2023-06-18 09:35:56","2023-06-18 09:35:56","246-265","","3","57","","Journal of Monetary Economics","Volatility and growth","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","E:\_Literature_Zotero\storage\XTL4UJVP\Volatility and growth - Credit constraints and the composition of investment - Journal of Monetary Economics - 2010.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
